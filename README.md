This repository contains the shell scripts used for whole genome sequence analysis from demultiplexing to variant calls

28 May 2018 -- Currently there are two options for calling variants \
GATK HaplotypeCaller is likely best but takes a very long time \
Samtools mpileup is faster, and may be decent enough for at least preliminary results

Notes on the first iteration of this pipeline on the rosy-finch data is located in rosyfinch_notes.md
